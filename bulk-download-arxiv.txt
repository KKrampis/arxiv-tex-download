Yes, it is possible to bulk download references cited in an arXiv paper by processing the LaTeX source file. Here’s a step-by-step guide to achieve this, along with tools that can help:

1. Download the LaTeX Source from arXiv

	•	On the arXiv paper page, click on the “Download source” option to get the LaTeX source files.
	•	Extract the .tar.gz archive to access the .tex files and the associated .bib file if available.

2. Extract References

	•	Using BibTeX: If the article uses a .bib file, the references are already stored in BibTeX format. You can process the .bib file to extract citation keys and download corresponding papers.
	•	From the LaTeX File: If no .bib file is present, references are often hardcoded in the .tex file (e.g., in a thebibliography environment).

3. Automate Reference Download

Here are tools and methods to automate downloading referenced papers:

A. Use Python Libraries

	•	Bibtexparser: Parse the .bib file to get DOIs, titles, or URLs.
	•	CrossRef API or Semantic Scholar API: Use these APIs to search for paper metadata and download them.

Example Code:

import bibtexparser
import requests

# Load .bib file
with open('references.bib') as bibfile:
    bib_database = bibtexparser.load(bibfile)

# Extract DOIs or titles
for entry in bib_database.entries:
    title = entry.get('title', 'No title')
    doi = entry.get('doi', None)
    print(f"Title: {title}, DOI: {doi}")

    # Download using DOI
    if doi:
        url = f"https://doi.org/{doi}"
        response = requests.get(url)
        with open(f"{entry['ID']}.pdf", "wb") as f:
            f.write(response.content)

B. Command-Line Tools

	•	arxiv-cli: A tool to search and download arXiv papers based on metadata extracted from references.
	•	PyPaperBot: Automates searching and downloading research papers using titles or DOIs.

C. LaTeX Bibliography Parsers

	•	Use tools like latexml or pandoc to convert LaTeX references into machine-readable formats.

4. Bulk Download Using DOIs or URLs

	•	SciHub: (For personal use in regions without access): Use a script to download papers using DOIs (check local regulations).
	•	Library Access Tools: Tools like Zotero with browser plugins can auto-download PDFs when given DOIs or URLs.

Example Workflow for .bib File

	1.	Parse .bib file for doi or url entries.
	2.	Use a Python script or command-line tool to bulk download papers.
	3.	Save the PDFs with a meaningful naming convention.

Let me know if you’d like help with a specific part of the workflow, such as setting up the Python script or using an API!
